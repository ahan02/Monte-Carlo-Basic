# Monte Carlo Simulation Basic

#### Monte Carlo Method is technique that involving generating random numbers to solve problems with probabilistic models. It is often called Monte Carlo Simulation since it replys on repeated random sampling.

### Randomization Analysis

It is used to test two different groups with null hypothesis of no difference, the mean differential is expected to be 0. 

### Permutation Analysis

It is used to compare means studies from two arms of patient responses to experiement, 1 represent yes, null hypothesis is no difference in response proportions. 

### Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping is resampling with replacement that alllows assigning measures of accuracy to sample estimates.
